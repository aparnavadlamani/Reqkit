Marshall VanOort,"I've loved the VLC player for as long as I've had it, but recently, it's become almost unusable. Whenever I use Bluetooth headphones to listen, the first second of each song is cut. When trying to listen to music, this can be really, really annoying. I'm not sure which update introduced this issue, but it's awful. I tried switching to a different media player, and the audio was fine, so it's an issue solely with VLC. It sucks that I have to use some other app until this is fixed.",304,4.4,"April 29, 2020"
Tom Rowe,Used to be my Player of Choice. But the latest version seems to have lots of bugs. Black screen on start up if it does start just a white blank screen. Uninstalling and reinstalling will fix the problems for a while but then the same problems return. Will have to look for a more reliable player. Which is a shame as this is the first time I have had problems with VLC. Recent reviews would indicate that other users are also having problems.,160,3,"April 29, 2020"
Soumyo Biswas,"I have some Russian and Japanese songs in my tracklist. Whenever I scroll down and get to those songs below all the English songs I have, the app refreshes the list within a second or two and there are no more songs in the library according to it. Refreshing it has no effect. I have to wipe it out from the memory and reopen the app to see all the songs again. And once again if I scroll down there the story repeats. Please find a fix for this. This never happened before getting songs in Russian.",55,1,"April 29, 2020"
CS Graham,"Playlists are a major headache. Looking under the menu item Playlists there is no create option. You must pick a track to add to a playlist and choose the option to add it to a new playlist. There if you add a directory to a playlist you see its name only. You will see its contents selecting the directory and doing something, but I'm not quite sure what it is. There is no way to select multiple tracks to add all at once to a playlist.",136,2,"April 30, 2020"
Lynn Atherley,"This app has been working great so far, especially when I have my bluetooth speakers connected to my phone. But now since I updated this app, when I'm watching my movies with my bluetooth speakers it wants to cut the audio out for a few seconds and then comes back on. And it does it about every minute through the movie. Talk about a mood killer! Please fix this problem, cause it really sucks having to watch a movie without my bluetooth speakers.",389,1,"April 21, 2020"
Vivek Patel,"This app is as good as it's desktop counterpart. It supports hundreds of file formats and will play anything you their at it. For example, I couldn't play .wma files on Google play music, but VLC solved ask these problems. However there's one bug: flac files sometimes appear to have no length. This doesn't affect playback, but it means you can't skip ahead.",429,4,"April 22, 2020"
Euclid Megara,"Great, simple music app. I don't like other apps because they all try to get you to stream, this one doesn't push stuff you don't want. I just wish that playlists were more quickly accessable when browsing your music collection: you have to leave audio and select playlists to see them, would be better if they were available via the menu at the top of the audio screen were genera, artist, album, etc. are located.",193,5,"April 25, 2020"
Katherine Bonay,"I've only used it for audio, but the program shuts down as soon as it is paused for too long, or when another app is opened. And the file (if opened via an external program) is not stored in the VLC play history, yet if I reopen it externally in VLC, half the time it starts from where it cut off. only positives are that it's nice to be able to jump to a certain time stamp, set up a sleep timer, and adjust the playback speed, but the rest is bad enough that I will be uninstalling this app.",245,4,"April 26, 2020"
Anton B,"Using this player for live radio (online m3u stream) in background mode for an two or three years... And elementary bugs still not fixed. Mmmm.... Whereis delete button (or clear) in stream history list? Why this nice player closes where internet switches from mobile to wifi or other way?? Why this nice player do not want to work more than 15 minutes in background? Every time i have to run player and by hands write down url (but now there is memory of urls, thanks).",7,1,"April 28, 2020"
Nikos Orologas,"It's what you'd expect from VLC. Plays any file, performs smoothly and allows customization. What I miss and really need to make this a 5 star experience is to be able to change the position of subtitles, like in the PC version. For devices like mine with 18:9 or other cinematic screen ratios, if watching a made for TV screen program, I want to take advantage of the full screen, so I zoom in a little to fill my whole screen and the subs are getting cuted out when I do that.",235,3,"April 21, 2020"
Shinoj Kumar,"When the screen locks, the app being kept on pause, the app crashes when the screen is unlocked. I have to restart the app again to play the video. Sometimes the video plays from where it crashes and sometimes it starts from the beginning. Please fix this. Other than this the app is very comfortable for me. One more request. Please include Movie in equaliser with movie effects coz the app is mostly used by users to watch movies, not to listen to MP3s.",362,4,"April 24, 2020"
Robert van der Laan - Clement,"Love the regular PC version, and this app has potential, but it's just so buggy and broken 👎 Just some issues: when clicking on an audio track, it doesn't just play and when done, continues to the next, but instead it opens a tab at the bottom with only that 1 track on repeat..When watching a video, you can't add it to a playlist (instead it will add ALL videos from your library to that playlist 😵😠). After searching a title of a video, you get the WRONG 1 when clicking on any found video.. 😡",184,1,"April 24, 2020"
Plisetsky,It lags the video and its too hard to pause it. Whenever i hit the pause button it lags the video so i just double tap it to stop but turns out it flashforward. Its kinda annoying. I thought this will help me watch videos and movies unlike on my video player but it is kinda worst. I have vlc on my phone last time but not like this.,1,1,"May 1, 2020"
Kudale Manoj,"The app is fine. But the problem is that if we receive a phone call while watching a video, we cannot continue, instead we have to close the app and restart it and in the process the video starts from beginning and we have to go for searching where we were. Hope this problem will be fixed at the earliest.",1,2,"May 1, 2020"
Dennis Penglase,"I've used this app since the Beta version and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! There's NOTHING even close to it. And it's FREE! I've given it one star in hopes this gets attention. A few updates ago, for some reason, it's started saving a pic locally (NOT ON MY SD CARD WHERE THE APP IS) for every single mp3 file. 10 songs in an album? Ten pictures saved. It's an issue. Due to the amount of music I have on my phone the data size locally is close to 2 gigs!!! Can this be fixed?",15,2,"April 24, 2020"
Kashish Bhatia,"I use the Screen cast (screen mirroring) option on my OnePlus 7t pro and then play videos through VLC. Since a few days, when I play the video after mirroring the screen, I see the Cast remote icon on the TV, same as the screen but the audio plays. Updated VLC to the latest version, but doesn't help. Using chromecast for the same btw and phone on Android 10. Please fix.",193,1,"April 20, 2020"
jack waller,"Having a big issue with the player not locking onto English in sound, I play a movie and boom German until I go into settings almost every time and switch it to English and I even put the lock ln and save and nope keeps doing it! Other then that I would give 5 stars happily",1,4,"May 1, 2020"
Anthony Smith,This is a great video player that can play files from phone storage and network shares but presently has some Chrome casting issues. Phone display keeps turning off preventing easy movie control and dropping the cast. Need a default option to keep screen on while casting. No subtitles during casting either. Would love to see these little issues fixed soon. Keep up the good work.,124,1,"April 27, 2020"
G D,"Does not play Youtube videosaudio properly. Many times will not play them at all. How to recreate bug: create playlist with 2 YT vids. Play the playlist on repeat. Wait until the bug shows up. Also there is no option to create proper Stream based playlist, with ability to name the tracks. Instead you get URL for track names...",99,4,"April 28, 2020"
James Douglas,"Can't be shut off! Always active! I use my headphone in-line controls for other apps. VLC ALWAYS! responds to the playstop button even when its supposedly inactive & stopped, even from within other apps that use this feature. There is no way to shut VLC down! MX Player and other apps don't do this. (Did a search re this and found the dev(s) has some hardsetwonky issues regarding 'QuitExit' feature requests. And whats with the sandboxed process0 entry in Memory list? On Note 9 Android 9",83,2,"April 25, 2020"
Hemant Kumar,"Best vedio player for watching movies. Some of the best features are downloading subtitle, it also maximize the volume upto 200. Suggestions: after downloading the subtitles we need to unzip it then need to select the subtitle, some convenient should offer in this process so that it can we accomplish seamlessly",1,2,"April 30, 2020"
Jacob Ford,"Make sure you back up your SD card. This app corrupted mine and I lost all my pictures and videos. It's buggy with several features that just don't work such as designating only certain folders to be scanned and creating playlists. The only good part about this app is that it does, infact, play videos.",13,5,"April 26, 2020"
David Elfleet,"Generally it does appear to be a good all round media player. However I have to drop a star since with last update the subtitles for videos played in landscape mode are not formated to the scale of the displayed video and as such unusable. Brilliant for use with dlna, pity about subtitles.",2,1,"April 28, 2020"
M Pell,"The app hangs when starting up if it is running from an SD card. It the app is moved back to device memory, it runs without problems. Android shows that this app can be moved to SD storage, but VLC does not run when that is done. Looking for an media player app that can actually run from SD storage to spare my limited phone memory.",35,4,"April 20, 2020"
Curtis Keen,Great app always has been But I need it for two things now 1. Is casting to my bedroom tv using a chromecast and it will detect the chromecast and work 2. Is connect to my living room smart tv (samsung) and will not come up with the option. Hopefully an easy fix as other apps will detect all casting deveices,2,2,"April 28, 2020"
Carol Tatarian,"Awful. Installed in on Samsung Android 9. Can't open my photos on SD card. Says Directory is empty, and it's not empty. Nothing wrong with SD card. Photos are there. What's up VLC? Tried moving app from internal to SD card , but then the app won't open.",,4,"May 1, 2020"
GAURAV RATHOD,"If we pause video and screen gets locked, after unlocking the screen it doesn't play the video from where it was paused. It crashes and have to start all over again... PS: It still doesn't have feature to skip to the time where it was closed... 😑. Please fix this ASAP 🙏",,1,"April 30, 2020"
Paul Molitor,"will not play URLs if you don't give it storage permission! Does nobody test this? I doesn't need access for anything I want to do with it, yet refuses to work without. now also seems to apply tricks to run in the background, seeing notifications pop up and disappear all the time.",5,2,"April 27, 2020"
Favour Emman,"I have been using this app since 2015 and it has always been good, no crash whatsoever until last week! I'm unable to download subtitles. It just keeps saying 'error occured'. And my friends have the same issue, some already deleted the app. You guys should plesse look into it",17,1,"April 23, 2020"
Subhadeep Pal,"In contrast to the pc version of this app, it sucks. There are many better video players on the play store. It is too simple, I can't see the codec used by the video or the resolution when the video is playing. I only use it because it has no ads and supports a wide variety of formats.",3,1,"April 28, 2020"
chintan gandhi,"No feature to select a particular language to always play first in case of a video with multiple audio. I have been waiting for this feature for so long.

GrimMo,"The best app ever. I have downloaded many anime such as Naruto Shippuden, One Piece and many more. This was the perfect app to watch all of them. I also listen to music I downloaded on VLC for Android rather than listening it on google play music and it was very great! But I think this app would be more awesome if you add a lyrics download for music just like the subtitles download for video. Other than that it was an AWESOME APP! Highly Recommended!",3,1,"April 29, 2020"
Kyler Greywacz,"There's some problems with the A-B Playback, with the button not changing when you disable it after using it, Another thing that kind of annoys me is when I do the repeat song option, it only stays on that song when trying to advance my current list of songs. Other than that, love the app",22,5,"April 20, 2020"
Alex Molina,"This has been my go-to app for years for media files. However, it's UI has become somewhat cranky lately. Sometimes the Play All button doesn't show up.

Saeed Simmons,"I don't know what's going on, but this has been my apps for many many years. Even on my laptop. Sense this new update, it doesn't even cast.. It recycles on the main page, by it self. An it doesn't go into portrait mode.. this is weird an crazy. Not like VLC..",4,1,"April 28, 2020"

Iama Strawman,Always great when it works. Keeps giving me a problem with not being able to find the right path to pull what I have already downloaded. Could be better if they could give tutorial on how and where to find path u can manually enter so it can find them.,22,1,"April 21, 2020"
Akintunde Omobolaji,"It's not quite the former app before the update. Now I am unable to download subtitles, it stopped working since like 5 updates ago...

Oreo Maxi,"I like to add something in this , video folders must b added , like the video is downloaded from fb so the folder should also be separated , like other apps they have separate all the video options for different downloaded videos , like insta video folder, fb video folder , camera video folder , i hope u guys understand it and in next update u guys also add this option ♥️",6,3,"April 23, 2020"

Nightcore Millenium,Why does it always play fast even i didn't turn on the save playback speed anytime i play videos?

Don Greer,I find not being able to organize the order of the songs in the playlists very frustrating. The order you add them is the order they will stay in. Many of my playlists need a certain order. This makes the playlist feature pretty much useless.,12,5,"April 24, 2020"

Also would be nice if there was an option to lock the header bar while scrolling through the list. Still the best media player tho, XoX",86,3,"April 18, 2020"

Josh R,I have this app solely to cast video and it doesn't really do that well at all. Volume control doesn't work (meaning I have to use my tv remote instead of phone to change volume). Organisation of videos is clunky. Subtitles do not work. I download them through the app and separently (through a subtitle website) and tried to add them. Still doesn't work. Also then doesn't cast the subtitles.,26,4,"April 17, 2020"

I downloaded alot of subtitle files for the same movie but it didnt even detect a single one. This was very troubling and I even tried the download subtitle option but it wont work either. Please fix this problem and I will rate it five stars again.,274,1,"April 13, 2020"

The cast to chromecast problem has been there for many years now, I even uninstalled and reinstalled and the new update don't fix it. That's why I only use this for the movies that won't cast with my other casting apps.",31,1,"April 14, 2020"
Ikuo Khresna,Great!!! I'm just found something interesting from this App. For you guys who love to listen to songs as background music when you're playing games or studying on your phone but unfortunately the song's volume is too loud..you can edit the equalizer on this App and The too loud song's volume won't bother you anymore..The equalizer effect is only giving effect to the songs that played on This App. I just found this hack a couple minutes ago.

Igor Podgorski,"Plays all the files OK. VLC is a standard. On Android subtitles are not visible during casting to Chromecast. They are visible when watched on smartphonetablet, though. I found a workaround to start the video on mobile device, with subtitles on (they're visible on mobile screen), then cast the whole device's screen from the system menunotifications, not from VLC. VLC figures out that it is being cast so it stops playing video on mobile device as it plays on Chromecast. Subtitles now show in cast to Chromecast. However, this is a strange mix of cast whole screen and cast video from VLC (VLC is aware of the ongoing cast), the screen has to stay on (no locking) although nothing is playing on it, just big VLC streaming logo. But the subtitles are now visible. It'd be great to get a fix for this. Works great from an SMB share, too.",489,1,"April 16, 2020"
Arvind Pillai,After opening a media file via file manager on minimising the app and while trying to return to the app it shows 'App isn't available'. Just for this reason i am giving it 1 star. This is a great app but this issue makes it unusable... even after a couple of updates it wasn't fixed. Suggestion- Insert the name of file in manual search of subtitle by default.

VLC is free (Availability) VLC supports different platforms (Cross platform) VLC doesn't need extra downloads to support any files you throw at it. It's actually fun to try and open random files with VLC, even something like .mkv (Matroska video format) which I know PS3 struggled back in the day and some other programs need codecs for and also phones need extra programs for, that often are either shady or no where up to speed.

Pedro V,I have been using the VLC player across all platforms without issues. The people complaining about VLC not working any more after switching to a new device are being inconsiderate towards the app since it's not possible for the developers to test every single Android devices in existence to see if they app works or not with your devices.
