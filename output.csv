"(3.2.7) It works fine. It's smart to put the ""Delete"" option at the BOTTOM of the list. (At other users. Use FILE MANAGERS to delete videos/ images/ music/ others.) Now I hope to see better performance for non SUPER hardware. Example = One of my phones has 2 GB of RAM, but only 480x854 resolution. I...
Full Review","Seek track is impossible to use. Whether I hold the fast forward or rewind button, tap the progress bar, drag the dot on the progress bar, or input seek time manually, nothing works. The behavior is erratic. This app is impossible to use for listening to audiobooks. 8 hours in one sitting with no br...
Full Review","I've been using the VLC Windows application for years & it's better than any others I've tried. This was the reason for choosing this app. However, the most recent update shrank the tool bar to less than full screen width and removed the ability to refresh the play list after deleting a played file....
Full Review","The updates just make it worse. I used to like sorting by date to easily find my latest added files. Now you can only sort by name. I just don't understand how it got less features after an update. Lots of other small issues with the later versions also. I'm actively looking for a new app as this on...
Full Review","I love VLC on my PC. Used to like it on my Android phone but it doesn't work on the S10+. I hate to give bad reviews but this app just doesn't work even after latest updates. Movies pauses every 2 seconds & doesn't restart. Time to look for a new video glare for android. I would prefer to use VLC, o...
Full Review","Glad to have the delete option back. Seems now the app has a problem keeping the filenames straight. Simply refreshing doesn't help. When I delete a file, the name is apparently assigned to a remaining file. I can only tell what the real filename is by looking at the information.","I've had zero problems with VLC. It does everything, plays everything. It streams. You can play movies as audio only so u can turn off the screen and fall to sleep listening to a movie. Pop up player is adjustable. I don't get why anyone would rate this less than maybe 4 stars, TBH.","My go to when it comes to a 3rd party media player, but I've had a few issues. Mostly with background playback, in other apps and screen locked, where it would continue to play for a few seconds, and then go silent, opening with no media queued. EDIT OF THE EDIT: Also doesn't seem to happen over Blu...
Full Review","Good media player for local storage, but frequently fails to browse network and load directories or play music, especially if connection is a bit slow. Once it fails, it usually needs be be closed and opened again. Would be happy to provide diagnostic information or help out to fix this, as otherwis...
Full Review","Great app when you think of playing many different media files. But impossible to bear on your mobile when you think of how much memory it occupies, and how many dozens of times a day it will repeat its media parsing again and again for countless minutes... Improve it, for God's sake. Solve that, pl...
Full Review","The Playlist experience is broken. If I change a Playlist, it doesn't auto-save like Microsoft Groove did. So I have to save the Playlist again. Except when I save over the existing Playlist, it appends the tracks to the existing Playlist instead of replacing the original list. So I have a playksit ...
Full Review","VLC for Android just isn't up to the standards of its PC counterpart. No matter what android device Ive used, I always run into some sort of hindrance when playing videos. Sound cutting out and not reappearing until I exit, video cutting out or distorting, etc etc. It finds a way to ruin anything I ...
Full Review","With every update VLC becomes more unusable than the previous updates that predated it. Every video will have an issue such as macro blocking, audio suddenly turning off, or the video just randomly shutting off. Trying to cast video to a chromecast will result in, maybe if your lucky, one to two min...

Full Review","Hi, before I updated. I was able to link my phone screen to the TV and watch as well play with my phone at the same time but now, it just links to the TV but my screen is fully seen so if I come off VLC Player to go on Google, that also shows whereas before it just showed the media file that was sho...
Full Review","Like a previous update which did the same, this recent update wiped all my playlists. No music will load into audio list even with directories selected, have to load manually from their locations. Lost my playlists again. Frustrating 😤 Also not loading video correctly. The past update that had this...
Full Review","Before the latest update the Player would cast to the TV and the display on phone would turn off while casting (nice Feature) or you could also use you phone it would still cast the content of the player without issue....now however it doesn't, you have to leave your display on all the time if you p...
Full Review","I love VLC very much cos it can open almost every file... I use it to watch all my videos and movies.. But this recent update isn't helping me..

I don't know if this has to do with an update, but whatever it is it's not working. Frustrating having to go back and put them in again......
Full Review","When watching a video and I pause it and my phone screen turns off, when I get back to the video the position of the video is correct but volume settings and subtitle sync delay I set gets reset, forcing me to redo the sync and volume settings every time I pause a video for a few minutes. Because of...
Full Review","This update sucks.. I want the old version back.. When ever I want to increase or decrease the volume by sliding on screen it always skip the video 10 secs.. And the second thing is that when I skip the video by double tap on screen it pauses the video at the same time.. Plz fix this problem as soon...
Full Review","So i finally used VLC today to test it. I only have one request. If i put my music videos and audios in one place, i need them to play that folder like a normal playlist...That is i can play an audio file and click next to play a video file with no problems like MX. If you implement this, i will be ...
Full Review","It still have the same issue of stopping music while playing video as audio after 30 seconds.

Full Review","Always the best video player, both on PC and mobile. I am not happy with one thing, subtitles in .smi format are not reproduced correctly. A code is shown instead of showing the apostrophe. Both on the computer and on Android. When you have full support for .smi subtitles, you get 5 stars.","This is the ""Swiss Army knife"" for Android, Fire and PC! 1.It plays every AV file type. 2.It speeds up talkies with minimal artifacts. 3.It slows down music without changing the key and with minimal artifacts. 4.Hotkeys on PC are useful. OPEN SOURCE IS THE FUTURE! Meritocracy, scientific method and ...
Full Review",This has been my primary video playing app for years but the latest update has really done a number on it. It forgets where it is and has trouble with some files types it never had before. It's still my preferred but if problems continue I will find something else.,"Damn guys I don't know what you did bit I hope you can undo it, mi vlc was working just fine, now it doesn't shows all my videos, can't sort them by size, video suddenly stops to rescan libraries, all kind of troubles it didn't had in the previous version.

Full Review",My video played as audio keeps stopping all the time. I did disable battery optimisation. Really can't figure out why the video keeps stopping after some time. I then need to pull out my phone and press play again.,"Updates shouldn't remove functionality, but they did. And wat were they thinking making longer filename's / tiles scroll? I can hardly read episode name or number anymore as one of them is constantly off screen. And ofc no setting to disable something like that.","I have used VLC across many platforms for probably the last 19 years and while there are a few extra options I would like for audio playback, I still recommend VLC exclusively to anyone that needs any type of media player.","Simply the best player on all platforms be it Android, Windows or Linux..runs all formats from mp3 to FLAC to x265 with no problems at all..also have plenty of awesome features like the ability to play videos in the background.. a feature that android lacked for 10 versions","It's a solid media player. Every time the app is launched and the first song is played, it crackles and stutters for the first few seconds. It does this EVERY time. Please fix this. It's exceedingly annoying.",A very good Music and Video Application. Reads various files very well. Playback is smooth and the EQ is welcome bonus. And thank you for making this professional application free as it is one of the best available. *****,Screen cast has stopped working. It says file path missing or something like that but it works fine on other players. Come on guys you are one of the best media player out there. I don't know how many more people are facing this issue,"Did last update and not working the full screen with one touch icon for full screen and you phone goes on black mode but now you see it on your phone and TV at the same time, please fix this it was a 5 star app.",It stops casting on the TV lately. It simply disappears out of nowhere as if I closed the app. What's the matter?? Mind that I have excluded it from battery optimization,"A great all around video and music player. Loved it on my PC, it is essential on my mobile devices. Yes, it is feature rich and it takes time to learn the all the fine points, but the effort is worth it.","Of all the countless media players I've used , either on phones or computers, VLC is by far the best. Never had any issues or complaints about it. Make your playlist, turn it on and close the screen an go about your business.",I can not for the life of me get subs to load. I have been using this app and it's been working fine for the last year and I have the srt files but it simply will not display.,"Many possibilities, but many bugs too! Playlists (sometimes) impossible to remove, too long to refresh even with 10 GB RAM!? Streams and iptv lists play options surprisingly very limited!?","This app does not play neither music video nor audio music, I don't exactly understand the problem, it just starts the audio music or video music then sports suddenly using android sumsang j4. Thanks in advance.",After update why video also play on mobile screen when cast to tv. In previous version there is a option to show video on mobile. But after update while casting to tv video plays on both tv and mobile. Plz help,"Really unintuitive. Adding files to playlists is awful! You tap on the playlist name, and it transfers the name down at the bottom as if to create a new playlist. And no indicator anything has happened. Terrible UI",Still best media player for me but comes with some issue with new updates for ea. selecting a song but other also get seleceted automatically while making a playlist and recent play option is not like old version ... i hope you guys make it better with new update,"Love VLC. However, the Google Chromebook I have is not working well with this version of the product. I find this to be more of a Google issue as VLC has always been dependable for me.",From last update I am unable to download subtitles. Please fix this Before it was very good I updated it again after my last review and problem is still the same. Even performance got worse before it was good.,It is a good video and music player which plays many video and music formats which probably cannot be played by other apps out there.It is personally my best video player.It is also a good sound booster to the audio of your media files.,"This app used to be great. I was able to choose & play multiple videos, not anymore. It now only plays the first video chosen and repeats until I choose the next video I want to play. Why?","I would like to report a bug. I have to load subtitle file everytime, i pause the video, and the screen offs. It happens with the integrated subtitles too",This app was great until the past couple of months. The Cast button no longer appears!! It's the ONE reason I got it for Android. I'm sad because I love VLC.,"audio quality not good in android 10. at same time, other video players work well. Cutting out audio in vlc player. Only what I hear is the background music. Just like karaoke of songs. please fix.","I still can't download any subtitles.

Sometime playing movie suddenly getting green screen. 3. Local network tab click and right side ui getting issue.,"Incredibly glitchy, which is sad because I've been a fan of VLC for years. They just can't seem to work this app out.","For those of you having playback issues where it stops after a few seconds to a minute, all you have to do is uninstall and reinstall VLC. Streaming, playing MP3s, etc. Now all play fine without stopping (unless there's an internet issue but that's different). I love this app. Good luck!",Overall great app it's may be more better if it have video sort by time in video. It take more time to get latest video which I recently added my folder.

Full Review",The app is very good but downloading subtitles is always hard as it says that it can never find subtitles and I hav to manually type in everything. . This feature was very useful until it stopped working :(,Data issues when connected via bluetooth. Most of my files cannot be read and get skipped over while connected to vehicle audio system. This has happened on two different vehicles.,New update makes it that if you pause video it resumes without sound. Had to go back to my menu and reselect the file to get sound again. Other than that it works great.,Good day. I tried downloading subtitles with this updated version but its not working. I deeply regret updating because now i can't enjoy my foreign movies. Thank you,VLC is consistently a quality software current with the video developments. It is easy to use and has a good variety of functions to help with watching all videos.,"Hello, I can't connect to smb anymore with 3.2.7 version on my NinkBox Android TV. Worked fine with 3.1.6. What happens ? Please fix this.","Although it's a great media player, my major problem is that subtitles get cropped when I change the screen aspect ratio.","This used to be the best video player app. Not any more. Was it really absolutely necessary to screw it all up with your constant compulsive ""development""? 10 years ago vlc was just perfect. Now it is unable to handle subtitles, it is struggling with the aspect ratio, the whole user experience has g...

Minimize the app 4.maximize the app again And it would start the seek time but video and audio would not play.","Hand-down the *best* media player, not only on Android, but on PC as well.

Full Review","Great app but have issues. Won't play audio/video. Have to constantly tap play and eventually audio will play. Tried force stop, phone reboot, reinstall... No diff",The best part that I personally like about VLC is the power to download subtitle for the specific video from the app itself. No need for extra work.,Unable to play video folder that plays using VLC on desktop. Only plays single files. Also refuses to return to start of video. So really of no use so will uninstall. Pity. Using Samsung J6.,Why don't m4a files play anymore? They use to until a while back. I could play an mp4 and the audio from the m4a with the same name would play automatically. That doesn't happen anymore.,Good app but since the last update it's having glitches. Minimize app and you have to start video from afresh. That is stressful,"Dont worry anymore , I installed MX Player - works great - previously: (WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS???

Full Review",Decent player but the Android Auto side of the app needs a lot of work. Biggest thing is that media rarely ever resumes when you launch the app in AA. This usually means I have to launch the app on the phone to resume playback. Really need to add resume button in AA like there is in the app.,"You changed the whole thing. Why? It was fine before. Now only 1 movie at a time. It won't play whole seasons of shows. When grouping it won't give you landscaping mode, just a straight on the left thumbnail list. You just can't leave things alone. I use this app every day. Now I'm looking for a new...

I like the different types of plug in it has. Just fool with them. Excellent Media tool. Works with all types of OS. Learned about the web plug in . Vlc should have a PDF instructions. I'll check. Sometimes we need to read them.,I enjoy using this app often and have no issues with any audio or video files.,"Fantastic app. Way better than the player built into my phone.

Full Review","There's a constant bug whereby everytime I open the app and it starts parsing media, the app size grows to more than 2 gigs and keeps growing. Fix your mess!! This is a media player, not a heavy game like PUBG, so it doesn't require such large memory occupation. Fix this cause it's annoying!!!!","I thought I would explain further now that 3 weeks have gone by and I haven't seen any changes to the subtitle issue.

Full Review",It's very user friendly It's the best app for music and videos in my opinion hoping it will advance in the coming years,"After the new update half the features don't work, The UI Was polished tho, So I guess that's a plus Scratch That, as of 9th Jan 2020 - All the features I used VLC for no longer work.

Full Review","This app has had really irritating problems for years, and I cannot even figure a way they haven't have fixed if ANY of the developers are actually using it. Sometimes videos will loop back to a certain point in the video when they're finished without the ab loop being turned on in any perceivable w...

Fast, simple UI, though a little slow when generating video thumbnails and need to refresh when new files present if the app still active (I set to manually scan, I guess if I set auto scan then maybe it will auto add into library).

Plus, when browsing through said folders containing my music, they were showing as empty. So I was about to...
Full Review",By far the best media player. Always used on laptop and android. Plays soo many formats. Just brilliant. One downside I had with the last update on my phone was that the list of playlists are now icons and I can't get them back to a normal text-list. Can't find the setting for that anywhere.,"It works perfectly for playing any file. But I can't give it 5 stars because of a glaring flaw - it literally cannot find anything. I can click on files in file explorer and it works perfectly, but the second I actually go into the app, it says it can't find anything. Playlists are now unusable.","Upgraded my review to 4 stars now that Playlists have ""Display in List"". Audio: Still no ""Seek Buttons"" (as can be enabled in Video). It is especially in audio podcasts that this is needed for easily going back a few seconds. Will give 5 stars when this is enabled.","VLC all time favourite player! Plays all formats! Been using it for years on PC and now on Android! Will never change it, especially with the new-ish ""download subtitles feature"". One problem though: With previous version the subtitle delay was not working, but with new version it has been fixed...B...

Full Review","It'll play anything you throw at it, but the management of files and playlists (and the UI in general) is total trash. It's strangely buggy, as though the developers don't even use their own stuff (they probably don't; they probably use a command-line interface or something).","I use this app to connect with my families main computer that has a shared hard drive of movies and shows, since this update with the SMB authentication I have been unable to connect as no password username combo is working and so, has made this app useless to me until it's fixed, which I hope they ...

Can't clear or stop from playing. HAD to uninstall this garbage to stop it.,"Latest version update has deleted one of my playlists, removed all the tracks from another and made the playlist interface wasteful and cumbersome. Often crashes (when unpausing from notification tray, for example). I didn't think it was possible for them to make this app worse, but they did!","Has become confusing. E.g. if opening in audio file from a file manager, it plays it in the background, and I have to open VLC from the status bar – and I can't change that behaviour. But once I got it set up, and as long as I start in VLC itself, it's pretty good.","resume playback still broke, unbelievable. Went to xplayer, has resume that works and perfect default touch action video control.","i like that it's open source & does a good job. however, playlists are not saving properly for me. sometimes it wipes an entire playlist that you've carefully put together - very frustrating. i would also appreciate if 200% Volume Boost could also be used for audio files, not just video files.","Subtitles downloading is too bad, the windows version works better but on mobile it lacks downloading good subtitle","Hate the new update display. Before update had side by side thumbnails to scroll down through, now has one long row of thumbnails I have to scroll all the way down to find music I want. Much slower. Restore former display and I give you five stars again.","This has to be one of the best video players we have today. If I could give a score of a 4.5, I would.

It does not appear at the bottom but instead it is positioned at 1/4 of the screen.

Thank you 5* EDIT: bug in new version, %% signs show everywhere when selecting ""Group videos by Folder"" in directory names. EDIT #2: I fixed it. I did this by going to Settings>Media Library Folders> and unckecking all video folders and then rechecking them :)",M4a files are detected with a lower length. 3 minute songs are shown to be 30 seconds long with a progress bar as long too.
